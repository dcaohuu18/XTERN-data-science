# XTERN-data-science

This is my work in response to the assessment prompt for the Data Science role of XTERN 2019. Please see the getting-insights notebook first before looking at the charging-stratergy. There's also an extension where I identify in which to set up the charging stations (See the charging-stations notebook)

Here's the prompt: 

###### Situation

Have you ever hopped on a scooter and realized the battery is dead? ðŸ˜£ What an upsetting experience! 

In order to prevent that horrible user experience from happening, the data science team is focusing its efforts on coming up with the best scooter charging strategy. 

You can find a data set below with scootersâ€™ current geolocation and power level. Power level ranges from 0 - 5 (0 as completely out of battery, 5 as fully charged). It takes 5 hours to charge a scooterâ€™s power from 0 to 5. TechPointX talent team also has a mega charging bus that drives around to pick up scooters and charge them inside. Unfortunately, the bus can only park and start at location 20.19 (xcoordinate), 20.19 (ycoordinate) and only travel 50 miles per hour. 

###### Your Task

Review the data set, and draw any conclusions you can find from the data set. Try to identify the most popular scooter location, demonstrate your findings using data visualization tools, calculate operation time cost (Operation Time Cost: How long it takes to fully charge all the scooters), and come up with the most efficient scooter charging strategy.
